    Function that solves the Bumpy Robot problem. 
    This algorithm is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm that searches for 
    the shortest path (in terms of time wasted) from an origin to a destination,

    Parameters
    ----------
    board : list
        A matrix of integers which represents the board of the problem.
     
    visited : list
        A matrix of integers that saves the least energy required to get 
        to the positions of the board from the starting position.

    M : int
        The amount of rows of the board.

    N : int
        The amount of columns of the board.
    
    start : list
        A list of two integers [rs, cs] which has the starting
