# Trees and Graphs Class

These are my online judge solutions from 2021 that I made on my 4th semester of
college for the Trees and Graphs class

There are some problems that have multiple files, some are optimizations, 
while others are tests.

Reading through these files in 2023 really makes me wonder what was 
going on in my mind in 2021. Where is the consistency in the coding style??? 
What happened here??? Why was I programming C++ like it was C#???
